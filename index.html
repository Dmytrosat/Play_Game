                    <h2>Description of the history</h2>
                    <h3>Samurai</h3>
                    <p>
                        A samurai is a representative of the military state in Japan in the 10th-19th centuries. During
                        the
                        Middle Ages, the samurai displaced the Japanese aristocracy from the place of the country's
                        leading
                        political power and created their own system of managing society - the shogunate. The content of
                        the
                        term <span>"samurai"</span> changed according to the circumstances of a specific historical era,
                        but its
                        component, which associated samurai with war or military service, remained intact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Samurai are mentioned as simple servants in the household of nobles.
                        In the sources of the 11th century, a samurai is an armed servant whose task is to protect a
                        suzerain - a prince, an official, an aristocrat, the abbot of a Buddhist temple or a priest of a
                        Shinto shrine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the 13th century, the saburai were a separate estate, the characteristic features of which
                        were
                        the presence of land ownership and servants, as well as the performance of military service as a
                        horseman.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the 15th and 16th centuries, when Japan plunged into an era of continuous internecine wars,
                        any
                        soldier began to be called <span>"saburaya"</span>. He could be a noble commander, an armed
                        peasant, and even
                        a
                        thug robber. At the same time, the phonetic change of the word "saburai" took place - it was
                        pronounced as <span>"samurai"</span>. This change was finally fixed in writing at the beginning
                        of the 18th
                        century.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the Edo period (1603-1867), the first legal definition of <span>"samurai"</span> appears.
                        They meant elite
                        servants of the shogun, provincial lords and their most significant vassals. The rest of the
                        former
                        military men and soldiers of the country, who were part of the most privileged status of
                        <span>"husbands"</span>,
                        were not called <span>"samurai"</span>, but <span>"soldiers"</span> - <span>"bushi"</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, all military personnel of medieval and modern Japan are often called samurai. This
                        approach
                        can be found in popular science or fiction. However, in professional scientific works, the use
                        of
                        the term samurai is more balanced, since the content load of the word <span>"samurai"</span> in
                        a specific
                        historical period is taken into account.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Bushy</h3>
                    <p>
                        The term <span>"samurai"</span> is often synonymous with the word <span>"bushi"</span>
                        (<span>"military man"</span>, <span>"warrior"</span>).
                        However,
                        these terms are not exactly the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first use of the word <span>"bushi"</span> is in the <span>"Continuation of the Annals of Japan"</span>
                        and has
                        nothing to
                        do with the phenomenon of samurai. The term <span>"bushi"</span> is used as an antonym for the
                        word <span>"civil
                            official"</span>. Only from the end of the 11th century, Saburai servants began to be
                        associated with
                        the
                        military - <span>"bushi"</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the middle of the 12th century, the semantic load of the words <span>"samurai"</span> and
                        <span>"bushi"</span>
                        coincided.
                        However, already at the end of the same century, in connection with the drafting of the
                        legislation
                        of the first shogunate, the scope of application of these concepts was clearly demarcated. The
                        term
                        <span>"samurai"</span> denoted an elite warrior, and the word <span>"bushi"</span> denoted the
                        rest of the
                        Japanese army.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the 15th and 16th centuries, these two words again became synonymous, but after the
                        establishment
                        of the Tokugawa shogunate and the creation of new legislation, the concept of
                        <span>"samurai"</span> was
                        again
                        attributed to the wealthiest strata of Japanese society. That is, in the 17th and 19th
                        centuries,
                        every soldier from the rank of <span>"husbands"</span>(士) belonged to a bushi, but not every
                        bushi could be
                        a
                        samurai.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, both concepts — <span>"samurai"</span> and <span>"bushi"</span> — are often used
                        interchangeably, but this practice
                        is
                        insufficiently justified in view of the history and semantic load of both terms.
